author_bio:
  "Michael W. Merriam (MWM) is several decades old and designs games with a view to sharpening perception of invisible systems.
  He was raised in Vermont, and lived in California for years before moving to New York City where he was active in the arts, 
  got his degrees (BA in Archaeology, another one in English & Comparative Literature, and an MA in Medieval Renaissance studies)
  and has worked as a creative writing teacher at the college level, teaching both undergraduates and MFA candidates. He has a background
  in several different kinds of media, but considers himself a mad scientist."
description: "This is the Ludonomicon (notes toward the compilation of my magnum opus, the Summa Theoludica, which I shall begin when I eventually turn 40."
footer_description:
  'The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the
  resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. While not everybody
  has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.'
